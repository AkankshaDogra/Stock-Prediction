### Stock Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various machine learning algorithms in Google Colab. The model processes historical stock data to forecast future prices, offering valuable insights for investors and financial enthusiasts.

## Project Overview
Platform: Google Colab
Languages: Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

## Features
~ Stock data preprocessing and feature extraction
~ Training machine learning models, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Visualization of historical and predicted stock trends
## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
You need a Google account to access and run the code in Google Colab.
Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts.
# How to Use
- Open the notebook in Google Colab.
- Upload or connect to a stock market dataset (you can use publicly available ones or connect to an API).
- Run the cells in the notebook to process the data, train the models, and visualize the predictions.
- Explore the results and adjust model parameters as needed for improved accuracy.
## Dataset
You can use any stock market dataset with attributes such as:
- Date
- Open
- Close
- High
- Low
- Volume
Make sure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before feeding it to the models.
## Visualization
The project includes graphs and charts to help visualize stock trends over time, including actual vs. predicted stock prices.
